				</header>

				<p>
					Invento v2 was created using Codeigniter 4, so in order to be able to install it, you'll need to meet these requirements:
					<ul>
						<li>Apache*</li>
						<li>PHP 7.4+</li>
						<li>intl extension enabled</li>
						<li>mbstring extension enabled</li>
						<li>MySQL 5.1+ with the MySQLi driver</li>
						<li>mod_rewrite enabled</li>
						<li>PHP extensions: php-json, php-mysqlnd, php-xml</li>
				</p>
				<small>* Codeigniter 4 also supports Nginx and Vagrant, but Invento v2 <strong>has not</strong> been tested on those platforms. Thus we do not assure Invento v2 will work in any of those platforms, only Apache.</small>

					<h3>Overview</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					The main idea behind Invento v2, is to be able to manage your inventory in one or several warehouses by logging the entrance and exit of merchandise. The latter is done by submitting purchases and sales.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you purchase items from one of your suppliers, stock will be added to a specific warehouse. When you sell items to one of your customers, stock will be deducted from a specific warehouse. This way, Invento v2 is able to keep track of all quantities, and to show you basic charts in your admin panel.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section-warehouses">
				<header>
					<h3>Warehouses</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					As soon as you install Invento v2, your first step should be creating your warehouses, since the entire system will work with them.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the <strong>Warehouses</strong> page, you'll find a list of warehouses.
				</p>

					</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you've just installed the system, this table will be empty. To create a new warehouse, click on <strong>New warehouse</strong>. Then, fill the warehouse details and click on <strong>Create warehouse</strong>. Create as many warehouses as you have.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section-suppliers">
				<header>
					<h3>Suppliers</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					Suppliers are people or companies you buy merchandise from. You get stock into any of your warehouses by buying items from suppliers. Thus, in order to submit new purchases, you must have at least one supplier.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the <strong>Suppliers</strong> page, you'll find a list of suppliers.

			<section id="section-customers">
				<header>
					<h3>Customers</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					Customers are people or companies you sell merchandise to. You get stock out of any of your warehouses by selling items to customers. Thus, in order to submit new sales, you must have at least one customer.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the <strong>Customers</strong> page, you'll find a list of customers.

					<h3>Translating</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					Invento v2 does support translation, and comes with 2 languages already included: English and Spanish.
				</p>

				<p>
					Language files are located in the <strong>/inventov2/app/Language</strong> path.
				</p>

				<p>
					To create a new language file, duplicate any existing language. For example, if you would like to translate to Chinese (CN), duplicate the <strong>/inventov2/app/Language/en</strong> directory (along with the Errors.php, Main.php and Validation.php files). Now, open each one of those files with your preferred text editor, and translate line by line.
				</p>

				<p>
					Done!
